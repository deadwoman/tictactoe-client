## User Story
- I want to know how many games I've played
- I want to be able to create an account
- I want to be able to log-in to my pre existing account
- I want to be able to sign out of my account
- When signed in, I want a logout button and change password option


## Future Edits
- I want varying difficulty so I feel like I'm being challenged
- I want to know how many wins/losses/ties X and O has
- I want to be able to keep track of how many wins/losses/ties I have so far
- As a user I want my game board and UI to be aesthetically pleasing and interesting
- Game description and rules
- Showing the user name (email)
- Make it a mobile friendly page
- Have a separate 'Stats' section using div.
- Fix the error where "New User? Sign Up" disappears once logged in and on the gameboard page.
- I want to center the log in/sign up credentials.
- I want to center the nav bar.
